					<rule id="1" type="intro" title="General intent">
						<body>General intent.  The purpose of any type of appeal is first, to allow for the proper awarding of points according to the rules; and second, to increase the quizzers\' and coaches\' confidence that the rules will be consistently applied by giving them opportunity to call attention to the rules when they feel one has been overlooked or misapplied. The intent of an appeal is not to steal points away from the opposing team on a technicality. The person making the appeal should keep in mind the goal of quizzing is to encourage the youth of both teams in their study of God\'s word.</body>

			h2 { "2. FM BIBLE QUIZZING RULES" }
			h3 { "2.1 TEAM & PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENT" }
			h4 { "2.1.1 Quizzers are seated on chairs with the same surface (preferably a hard, flat surface, not a chair with a cushion), facing the audience, one team on each side, in any order they choose." }
			h4 { "2.1.2 The Quizmaster sits or stands in front of the quizzers at a table or podium with his/her back to the audience, facing the teams." }
			h4 { "2.1.3 A timekeeper may be at the table with the Quizmaster or elsewhere in the room." }
			h4 { "2.1.4 A scorekeeper may be at the table with the Quizmaster or elsewhere in the room." }
			h4 { "2.1.5 Each team\'s coach may be at the table, if space allows, or elsewhere in the room." }
			h4 { "2.1.6 Audience members and substitute quizzers should remain behind the Quizmaster\'s table." }
			h4 { "2.1.7 Answer Consultants.  Having answer consultants is not mandatory. However, the Quizmaster may appoint them either before a quiz or while it is in progress if some additional advice is needed in order to make a correct judgment or decision.  If appointed before a quiz, answer consultants should keep their Bibles open and follow along with the questions and answers to keep track of what is said. Ideally, they should be provided with their own set of questions and answers.

			The number of answer consultants used is strictly up to the quizmaster, and their role is solely to give advice when requested. The Quizmaster makes all final judgments. They should speak softly so they won\'t be overheard, and let the Quizmaster give an assessment of the situation before stating their opinion. " }


            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.2 TEAM CAPTAINS" }
			h4 { "2.2.1 One captain shall be chosen by the coach to represent the interests of the team during the competition. The captain shall choose sides, introduce the team, make appeals, request timeouts, call for substitutions and select teammates to answer in the case of jump ties. " }
			h4 { "2.2.2 If a captain leaves the contest for any reason (most commonly from quizzing-out), the coach should appoint an \"acting captain\" and notify the Quizmaster. While competing, an acting captain may perform all the functions of the regular captain." }







            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.3 QUESTIONS" }
			h4 { "2.3.1 Legal Introduction to the Question.  The Quizmaster is to introduce each question in the following manner:  
			\"Question, Question number ___, Question.\"  
			Any marked question type shall be announced in this introduction:  
			\"Question Number Four is a Two-Part Question.\"  
			If the quizmaster inadvertently states this another way and in doing so prompts a forfeit jump or prejump, a procedural appeal may be made, and the question or a substitute question should be read without penalizing the quizzer. If a Quizmaster misstates the introduction, but completes the question with no prejumps being registered, no appeal will be accepted concerning the error in the introduction." }
			h4 { "2.3.2 Legal Reading of the Question.  The Quizmaster shall read questions loudly enough so that all words can be heard easily by all quizzers. In large rooms, a sound system might be used.  The Quizmaster shall read the questions clearly and correctly so that all words are easily understood. Mistakes of pronunciation are permissible only if the words are still clearly recognizable and if the error does not throw off the timing of the question.  The Quizmaster shall read the questions at a moderate pace. Reading too quickly or too slowly, or with inordinate pauses, may trigger unintended prejumping.  If noise interference or other distractions prevent a question from being clearly heard, the quizmaster will re-read or replace the question." }
			h4 { "2.3.3 Ruling on answer.  Quizmasters are encouraged to have their Bibles open and double-check answer sheets with the actual Scripture text.  This is also helpful if a quizzer's answer goes beyond what is written on the question/answer sheet. On any ruling, the decision of the Quizmaster is final unless appealed by a captain or coach before the next question is started. If an appeal is raised, the decision of the Quizmaster on appeal will be final.  The Quizmaster may, on his or her own initiative, correct a decision he/she realizes to have been incorrect when made.  This should be done as soon as the error is realized, and before the next question is ruled upon." }
			h4 { "2.3.4 Appeal.  If any of the conditions above are thought to be violated, an appeal of the procedure may be given. Although Quizmasters are at liberty to seek the counsel of others, they shall be the sole authority on whether the question should be re-read, replaced, or allowed to stand as read." }
			h4 { "2.3.5 Re-reading the Question/Repeating Words.  Ideally, a question is to be read only once in team competition, and re-read only in the event of a missed prejump. " }
			h4 { "2.3.5.1 Veteran competition.  In the event that excessive time is needed by the Quizmaster to make a ruling, consider an appeal, or deal with some other interruption, the question may be repeated. The Quizmaster may also choose to repeat the question due to noise interference. Repeating should include the last full word and any portion of a partially read word.  Re-reading (with no loss of answer time) might be an accommodation for those with special conditions like ADHD. (See section on Special Accommodations, 2.23)" }
			h4 { "2.3.5.2 Rookie competition.  In Rookie quizzes, the question may be re-read upon request, but this shall be done during the requesting quizzer\'s 20-second answer time.  The first person to jump (whether on the initial reading or on the re-reading due to a missed prejump) will not be granted a repeat of the question." }
			h4 { "2.3.6 Clarification allowed.  If quizzers in a veteran quiz are unsure (perhaps due to accent, pronunciation, a homonym, or a disturbance in the room) of a word or phrase read within the question they may ask the quizmaster for a specific clarification between two words or syllables. (\"Did you say \'fall\' or \'full\'?\")  In the case of a completed question the text in question will be immediately repeated by the quizmaster if one of the quizzer\'s suggested options is correct (but shall answer \"No,\" if neither of the options given by the quizzer is correct).  A request for the Quizmaster to repeat the \"last word\" or \"last syllable\" that was read (as opposed to clarifying between two possible words) should be denied in the case of a prejump and is within the quizmaster\'s discretion in the case of a completed question." }
			h4 { "2.3.7 Calling on quizzers.  The quizmaster must call on a quizzer before the quizzer\'s time begins.  Quizzers should be called on by name." }
			h4 { "2.3.8 Identify a prejump.  The quizmaster must signify a \"prejump\" when calling on a quizzer if the completion of the question, not the answer, needs to be given.  Example:  \"Prejump, please complete the question, John.\"" }
			h4 { "2.3.9 Legal Questions.  Tournament questions will be written using the New International Version (c. 2011) of the Bible.  All questions must be based on the announced book(s) of study for that quiz season. No question may be asked which requires a background of general Bible knowledge or depends on any other outside source for its comprehension.  " }
			h4 { "2.3.10 Quote Questions.  Only verses contained in the Official List of Quotes for that quiz year may be used as tournament Quotes.  If an exact quotation is expected for an answer, the word \"quote\" must be both announced as the question type and included in the question. If the question says \"give,\" \"state,\" or \"indicate,\" it does not call for an exact quotation." }
			h4 { "2.3.11 No Yes/No or True/False questions.  Questions may not be asked which require yes/no, or true/false answers." }
			h4 { "2.3.12 Cross Questions.  If the complete answer to a question would require portions of more than one chapter or book, the question should be labeled \"cross-chapter\" or \"cross-book.\"   If the answer requires portions of different parts of the same chapter (separated by at least one verse or in a different paragraph or section), the designation \"all-chapter\" must be used and all portions that fully answer the question must be given.  It is possible that a question that is not \"cross\" early in the season may become \"cross\" when additional chapters are included in the applicable range of study." }
			h4 { "2.3.13 No references used except for Quotes.  Book names, authors and key words or phrases may be used to limit the scope of an answer, but chapter and verse references may not be used for this purpose unless they are among those listed on the Official List of Quotes." }
			h4 { "2.3.14 Content-based, without interpretation.  All questions should be directed toward what the Bible says, not what it means. Interchanging pronouns with proper names and stating other simple variations of the text are acceptable, but questions involving interpretation beyond the obvious implications of the text are not permitted." }
			h4 { "2.3.15 Complete.  Every question must be complete in itself. It should not depend upon a previous question or answer for any information." }
			h4 { "2.3.16 Clarity.  All questions must be worded so that their meaning is clear." }
			h4 { "2.3.17 Question Types to be Announced.  The Quizmaster must notify quizzers of the \"question type\" in advance of the following types of questions: those with two or more parts; those beginning with a "statement" followed by a question; \"cross-chapter\" which require information from more than one of the current quiz chapters; \"cross-book\" questions which require information from more than one of the current quiz books; \"all-chapter\" which require answers from different parts of a single chapter; and \"Quote\" questions. This notification should be given within the legal introduction described above." }
			h4 { "2.3.18 Two-part questions.  A question has two parts if:
			*  There are two subjects with one verb.
			*  There are two verbs with one subject.
			*  There are two question words.
			*  There are two parts (objects) in a key prepositional phrase.
			*  There is a divided predicate (two objects of the verb).

			Note: If the answer is single and applies to both parts, the words \"both ... and\" may be used to eliminate the two parts. Questions that ask for comparisons or relationships between objects are not two parts because these words connote two parts.

			*  A Quote involving more than one of the stated verse(s) references given on the Official List of Quotes." }
			h4 { "2.3.19 Three-part questions.  A question has three parts if:
			* There is a two-part question followed by a one part question.
			* There are three question words in the question with single subjects and objects.
			*  There are three subjects with one verb.
			*  There are three direct objects with one subject and one verb.
			*  There is one subject with three verbs." }
			h4 { "2.3.20 Four-part questions.  A question has four parts if:
			*  It has four question words.
			*  It has a two-part subject and a two-part verb." }
			h4 { "2.3.21 Five- and Six-part questions.  A question with additional multiple parts is normally connected to the number of question words it contains." }
			h4 { "2.3.22 A question shall be considered as a \"legal\" tournament question only if it meets the preceding requirements. Any question which does not meet these guidelines may be appealed. " }




            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.4 QUIZ CONSTRUCTION" }
			h4 { "2.4.1 The following guidelines are suggested (but not required) of those writing tournament questions." }
			h4 { "2.4.2 Progression of Difficulty.  Early in the year the questions will be generally less complex and deal with fewer chapters. Later the questions will become more comprehensive, sometimes asking for facts from several verses, chapters, or even different quiz books. The difficulty of questions will vary for the different divisions (i.e., an \"A\"-level question for Senior Teens or veterans and a \"B\"-level question for Rookie or B divisions)." }
			h4 { "2.4.3 Non-sequential.  Questions should be mixed in sequence; that is, they should not follow verse by verse from the book." }
			h4 { "2.4.4 Answer and reference included.  For the benefit of the Quizmaster and consultants, answers should be written out with the reference clearly indicated immediately following the question. In questions with multiple answers, they should be listed 1, 2, 3, etc., to aid in tracking." }
			h4 { "2.4.5 Question distribution guidelines:   In a 15-question quiz, the following distribution is recommended:
			*  Two Quote Questions;
			*  Two Cross-Questions; one portion of the answer should come from the current month\'s material;
			* After the first quiz of the season, two review questions (exclusively from prior material studied);
			*  Up to five (5) questions in a 15-question quiz might contain review material (i.e., any combination of review questions, cross-questions and Quote questions).
			*  In a 20-question Quiz, an additional Quote, Review and Cross-Question can be added." }
			h4 { "2.4.6 No appeal.  These guidelines are intended to assist Question Writers and to provide quizzers a general expectation within any given quiz round.  Deviations from these guidelines are allowed, so as to avoid too much predictability, and shall not be grounds for an appeal." }




            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.5 POINTS AND SCORING" }
			h4 { "2.5.1 Points for Correct Answer.  Each correct answer, regardless of type of question or difficulty, is awarded 20 points.  In a 15-question quiz, a total of 300 points is available. " }
			h4 { "2.5.2 Quiz-out.  In both Team and Individual Competition, a single quizzer will quiz-out after their individual point total reaches 100 or more points; and that quizzer is not allowed to re-enter that quiz, even in overtime. In Team Competition, a substitute may be appointed to replace the quizzer who has quizzed-out." }
			h4 { "2.5.3 Scorekeeper.  In official quizzes, one scorekeeper will be appointed by the Quizmaster who will record the results of each question on an Official Scoresheet. (See sample scoresheet is at the end of this Rulebook.) A second scorekeeper might be recruited for an accuracy check. (Frequently quizmasters or coaches keep a scoresheet for their own use and can function in this capacity.)  Digital scoresheets are available and encouraged." }
			h4 { "2.5.4 Spaces to complete on scoresheet.  As quizzers are introduced, their names should be recorded in the proper spaces provided on the scoresheet. Also record the team names (and tournament ID numbers - if assigned) at the top of the scoresheet. Warnings and Infractions are recorded with W\'s or I\'s given to the appropriate individual or team by the quizmaster and are recorded next to the specific question where they are issued, as well as at the bottom of the page in the appropriate \"totals\" blanks.  Time-Outs are to be recorded as they are taken by each team." }
			h4 { "2.5.5 Points recorded.  Individual as well as team points will be recorded for each question, with each correct response earning 20 points for both quizzer and team. 20-point deductions (against the team\'s score in team quizzing, but the individual\'s score in individuals) shall be recorded when announced by the quizmaster for a missed appeal. (Not all missed appeals receive deductions.)" }
			h4 { "2.5.6 Scores compiled.  At the end of the quiz, the scorekeeper totals the points for each quizzer and team, enters the totals into spaces provided, and returns the scoresheet to the Quizmaster.  The Quizmaster is responsible for delivering the completed scoresheet to the designated location.  Digital scoresheets shall be sent to the address designated for that tournament." }



            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.6 SCORESHEET INSTRUCTIONS" }
			h4 { "2.6.1  General.  Keeping score for a quiz is a way to be helpful in a quiz tournament. " }
			h4 { "2.6.2  Pen with pressure for paper scoresheets.  Use a ballpoint pen and apply sufficient pressure, especially when using triplicate scoresheets. Before the quiz starts, fill in all blanks at the top of the sheet. Write each quizzer\'s name in the rectangles numbered 1-6. (Note there is space for 2 teams.) Use the quizzer\'s first and last names or at least an initial.  A laptop or electronic tablet or similar device will be needed for digital scoresheets." }
			h4 { "2.6.3  Correct answers.  Each correctly answered question is worth 20 points. Mark a 20 in the column of the quizzer who answered, then add twenty to that team\'s running score and mark it in the middle column." }
			h4 { "2.6.4  Inset box.  The small box inside each of the individual scoring boxes is used for two similar functions:" }
			h4 { "2.6.4.1 Note the prejump.  Where there is a prejump, mark the box with an X in the appropriate quizzer\'s column. If he or she proceeds to answer correctly, 20 points are given. " }
			h4 { "2.6.4.2 Missed prejump completion or answer.  If, on the other hand, the quizzer cannot complete the question correctly, or answers incorrectly, the small box should be darkened in. This is important especially in Individual Competition when penalties are made against the quizzer who accumulates too many.  Using an \"M\" on the digital scoresheet will fill in this box." }
			h4 { "2.6.4.3 Jump order.  The box may be used to record jumping order. If there is no prejump, place a 1 in the small box of the first quizzer to jump, a 2 in the box of the second, all the way to the fourth. This is reflected on the electronic jump seats display. " }
			h4 { "2.6.5 Running score.  The center columns are used for the running score. When a quizzer scores, a \"20\" is placed in his or her personal column, and the running score is adjusted accordingly. Mark these columns promptly, as the Quizmaster may ask you for the official score at any time." }
			h4 { "2.6.6 Individual Competition. The running score columns are not used in individual competition.  Instead, each quizzer\'s running score is maintained in their own column." }
			h4 { "2.6.7  Questions \"in.\"  An important feature of the quiz scoresheet gives the statistician the ability to calculate a weighted average for each quizzer. These are the boxes at the bottom of the scoresheet under the caption \"No. of Questions \'In\' Per Quizzer\". When a quizzer is substituted out of or into a quiz, draw a dark line on the line directly beneath the box of the question that was just completed (in the column of that quizzer). At the end of that quiz, you can quickly determine the number of questions a quizzer was \"in.\" " }
			h4 { "2.6.8 Totals.  At the end of the quiz:
			*  Total all columns, including the final score.  Digital scoresheets will auto-tally.
			*  Put the number of questions that each quizzer was \"in\" the match in the appropriate boxes. (For most quizzers this number will be 15, but if they quizzed out or were substituted in or out, this number will be less.)
			*  Have a representative from each team initial the scoresheet next to the team name.  If digital scoresheets are used, give each captain or coach the opportunity to view the scoresheet onscreen before submitting.
			*  Give the scoresheet to the Quizmaster to be checked, initialed, and distributed. In the case of triplicates, the top page is to be turned in to tournament officials, and the bottom two sheets can be given to coaches.  Digital scoresheets can be emailed to each coach, captain, church representative or others as determined by the tournament director." }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.7 QUIZ FORFEITURE" }
			p{ "Failure to appear.  Any team failing to appear within ten minutes after the announced beginning time (except for completely unavoidable circumstances) will automatically \"forfeit\" the round. Acceptable lateness might include a prior quiz running late, a mix-up on time and place where the participating team is not at fault, a transportation breakdown with the late team still arriving within a reasonable period of time, etc. The tournament coordinator (upon notification from the Quizmaster) shall rule on the validity of the team\'s reason for lateness. The decision is final. " }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.8 TIME LIMITATIONS" }
			h4 { "2.8.1 Time limits are as follows:
			*  5 seconds ... to stand after a question has been completed by the Quizmaster.  A quizzer who has not stood up within this period of time may not answer and if they are called on to answer, the Quizmaster is to be alerted immediately that the quizzer is ineligible to answer.  In online quizzing, this time period applies to \"buzzing in\" to register an intent to answer.
			*  20 seconds ... to complete a prejump after being recognized by the quizmaster.
			*  20 seconds ... to answer a question, whether it was finished by the quizmaster or completed by a quizzer who prejumped. This time period starts when the quizzer is recognized by name, or told he/she may \"proceed\" or \"answer\" the question he/she completed.
			*  30 seconds ... to present an appeal or to rebut an appeal.
			*  60 seconds ... for Time-outs.
			*  10 minutes ... before a team forfeits a quiz if the Tournament Director (upon notification from the Quizmaster) does not find the team\'s reason for lateness satisfactory (based on the announced or revised starting time for the quiz).  All forfeits must be approved by the Tournament Director." }
			h4 { "2.8.2 Timekeeper.  One timekeeper will be appointed by the Quizmaster to keep track of and report the ending of all time limits described below. The timekeeper might also be instructed to call out \"JUMP\" when any light comes on (not noticed by the Quizmaster) after the third introductory word \"question.\" This means that the timekeeper must be positioned to clearly see all lights." }
			h4 { "2.8.3 Call \"Time.\"  A timekeeper is to announce any end of time limits by loudly and clearly calling out the word, \"TIME.\"  In tournament play it is strongly preferred that a device be used that can automatically signal the end of the time with a tone.  " }
			h4 { "2.8.4 Tie goes to the quizzer.  If the Timekeeper calls \"Time\" (or an electronic tone sounds, if used) as the quizzer is saying his/her very last word of the answer, the benefit will be given to the quizzer and, if the answer is correct, points will be awarded." }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.9 JUMPING" }
			h4 { "2.9.1 Legal Jump.  A legal jump is any activation of the electronic quiz box light; providing a legal jumping posture has been adopted, the Quizzer continuously rises from the jump position and does not sit back down.  If a light goes on and off quickly and the quizzer continues to rise, this constitutes a legal jump, even though the light may no longer register due to a malfunction." }
			h4 { "2.9.2 Legal Jumping Position.  All contestants must be seated on chairs facing the quizmaster. The seat pad must be flat on the top surface of the chair. Quizzers must activate their light in a manner that brings them toward a standing position in a smooth motion.  Quizzers may not touch any part of the chair, floor or any object with their hands; feet may only touch the floor.  The use of non-slip material between a seat pad and the chair is allowed." }
			h4 { "2.9.3 Ties in jumping on a completed question.  If two quizzers on opposite teams jump simultaneously, one quizzer shall answer privately to the Quizmaster (outside the room to prevent others from hearing), and the other quizzer will answer before the audience. If both are correct, each team receives the total point value of the question.  The Quizmaster shall not rule on either answer until both are heard.

			If two quizzers on the same team jump simultaneously, the captain shall choose the first to answer to the audience. If declared incorrect, then and only then shall the other quizzer be called upon to answer. In no situation may one team score more than 20 points per question." }
			h4 { "2.9.4 Tie on a Prejump.  If members of opposing teams tie on a prejump, one shall complete the question privately to the Quizmaster and the other aloud to the audience. If only one quizzer\'s completion is acceptable, that quizzer will answer aloud to the audience. If both are correct, one shall answer privately to the quizmaster and the other aloud. If neither are correct, either in completing the question or answering it, the question will be declared closed and the quizmaster will move on to the next question.

			If teammates tie on a prejump, only the quizzer selected by the captain to complete the question will be considered. If incorrect, the question will be re-read for the other side as in a normal prejump." }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.10 TIES" }
			h4 { "2.10.1 In a quiz.  In case of a tie at the end of a regulation quiz, there will be an overtime in which three questions will be asked. If there is still no winner, one question will be asked until a correct response determines the contest (\"sudden death\"). Before the overtime begins, a free time-out will be granted and substitutions may be made. No further time-outs will be allowed during the overtime (unless called by the Quizmaster)." }
			h4 { "2.10.2 In a tournament.  If two or more teams tie in win/loss record for a Round Robin Tournament the primary deciding factor will be who won the head-to-head competition (when the teams played each other). In the case of a circular tie where team A beat team B, team B beat team C, and team C beat team A, a point differential method (which compares the scores only from rounds when the three teams played each other) will be used to rank the placement of all three teams  In the rare case where teams are tied in all of these areas, the tournament director may either hold a three-question play-off between the teams or use another equitable method which may include the sum of all points earned by the teams across the day.  This should always be a last resort method to encourage teams to always practice good sportsmanship.  It is likewise acceptable for the tournament director to declare any ranking or award to be a tie. " }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.11 SUBSTITUTIONS" }
			h4 { "2.11.1 Defined.  A fourth or fifth team member may be considered as a \"substitute quizzer.\"" }
			h4 { "2.11.2 Limits.  Substitutions may be made by the coach or captain any time between questions, up to a maximum of five times per quiz." }

			h4 { "2.12.1 Requesting a Time-out.  Two sixty-second time-outs per team in a team quiz, and one sixty-second Time-out per Individual in an Individual quiz, may be requested by coaches or captains or Individuals during a quiz, and granted by the Quizmaster. Time-outs may be called only after a question is closed and before the next question is introduced. As a courtesy to both teams, when an appeal is being considered and when a team asks for a Time-out, the quizmaster is encouraged to ask both teams if they are ready for the question to be closed before allowing the Time-out.  A Time-out is not declared when requested, but rather when the Quizmaster grants it." }
			h4 { "2.12.1.1 Cut-off for requesting a Time-out.  No Time-outs may be called after the beginning of the third question from the end of the quiz; i.e., question 13 in a 15-question round, or question 18 in a 20-question round, nor after the start of Overtime. An official Time-out may be called by the Quizmaster at any time, even when a question is still \"open.\" (The Quizmaster may need this time to check for equipment failure, seek advice, or do anything else necessary for the fair awarding of points on any given question.)" }

			h3 { "2.21 APPEAL OF PROCEDURE" }
			h4 { "2.21.1 Defined.  An appeal of a procedure is any objection legally raised concerning a rule violation which places the proper awarding of points in jeopardy, so long as the rule violation does not pertain to the question, answer, or prejump completion (which makes it an appeal of the question, answer, or prejump, respectively), but rather concerns some other rule or procedure which governs the fair awarding of points." }
			h4 { "2.21.2 Not allowed.  An appeal of procedure may not be raised if the fair awarding of points is not in question." }

            //***************************************************************************
			h3 { "2.22 WARNINGS AND INFRACTIONS" }
			h4 { "2.22.1 Illegal Conferring.  Quizzers cannot intentionally provide answers to team members or confer with each other, the coach, or with the audience by signal or voice from the time a question is begun until it is closed. A Quizmaster may give Warnings and Infractions to individual quizzers or to teams in violation.  No Scripture portions may be used by a quizzer in competition, though quizzers not in the competition at the moment (such as substitutes and those who quizzed out) may look in the Scriptures during the quiz." }
			h4 { "2.22.2 Illegal Discussion.  A question may not be discussed after it is closed if the Quizmaster is unwilling to discuss it. Quizzers, coaches, or fans who persist in this type of \"discussion\" may receive Warnings and Infractions. Coaches and quizzers do have the right to ask the quizmaster any question they wish between questions, and Quizmasters may answer if they wish. But if the Quizmaster indicates an unwillingness to discuss the point in question, the issue must be dropped.  (After the round is completed can be a good time for a quizzer or coach to ask a Quizmaster for insights on the ruling on a particular question.)" }
			h4 { "2.22.3 Warnings and Infractions.  Any Quizmaster or tournament director may give Warnings and/or Infractions to any team or individual who illegally confers, has illegal discussion, or exhibits disruptive or inappropriate behavior during any quiz or tournament. Warnings and Infractions will be given either to an individual or to a team, but not to both. Upon the third Warning, an Infraction will be given. The first Infraction will cause that team or individual to forfeit the question, with points automatically being awarded the other team. The second Infraction causes that team or individual to forfeit the quiz, and the third Infraction would mean elimination from the tournament. All Warnings and Infractions shall be recorded on the Official Scoresheet or Record Sheet with a capital \"W\" or \"I.\" While it is certain that these penalties will seldom if ever have to be used, it is hoped that their existence will foster closer observance of the rules and more discreet behavior. 

			Note: If a violation immediately jeopardizes the fair awarding of points, an Infraction may be given with no advance Warning." }

			h4 { "2.23.1 Jumping.  Quizzers may be granted an accommodation for purposes of a tournament if they are approved for this status by the tournament coordinator. If there is a disability such that normal jumping is either difficult or impossible, the quizzer may be allowed to compete with hand-held equipment, by activating the chair switch with the hand, or by any other mechanism so approved." }
			h4 { "2.23.2 Time Limit.  If a disability significantly slows a quizzer\'s rate of speech, they may qualify for a 30-second time limit in place of any 20-second time limit if approved for this by the tournament coordinator." }
			h4 { "2.23.3 Rulings.  If the quizzer\'s disability is such that speech is hard to understand or articulation difficult, Quizmasters may be more lenient in judgments of word clarity or allow more time for answering. The correct answer, however, must still be given in order for the quizzer to qualify for points.  Rereading consideration (with no loss of answer time) might be provided for those with special conditions like ADHD." }
			h4 { "2.23.4 Other Accommodations.  Any disability that affects a quizzer\'s ability to quiz should be taken into consideration on a case-by-case basis." }
			h4 { "2.23.5 Process.  Special needs and requests for accommodation should be brought to the tournament director for consideration ahead of the competition and, if granted, a notice shall be signed by the Tournament Director and presented to the Quizmaster in advance of the quiz.  The scorekeeper, timekeeper, captain and coach of the other team shall be informed about the nature of the accommodation to be granted." }

			h3 { "2.24 EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS" }
			h4 { "2.24.1 Defined.  An \"Equipment malfunction\" shall be called only when there is little or no doubt in the mind of the Quizmaster that the equipment is actually at fault. Any claim should be thoroughly investigated. A quizzer sitting precariously on the edge of the pressure point (where the least motion might activate the light) should be cautious in claiming an equipment failure. However, there may be legitimate cases of: 
			(a) a jump where the quizzer declares innocence, 
			(b) a light that seems to flicker or activate simply by moving the wires, or 
			(c) a seat pad demonstrating a reproducible delay in activating its light.

			The procedure in 2.17.4 should be followed for correcting the problem. The Quizmaster shall be the sole judge as to whether or not the equipment is to blame, and may take any necessary action to fairly continue with the question and deal with the problem." }
			h4 { "2.24.2 Discretion to address.  If the accuracy of the electronic equipment is questioned and its malfunctioning verified, the Quizmaster may alter normal proceedings in any way which is fair and impartial. This might include re-reading the question (in the case of a prejump where no key words were given), or reading a substitute question (if key words were given, or if a question was completed and it was impossible to tell which quizzer was really up first, etc.).
			" }
			h4 { "2.24.3 Questions replaced.  If the quizmaster determines that an equipment malfunction has possibly altered the outcome of a quiz, all affected questions shall be thrown out and replaced with new questions. If a prejump resulted because of the malfunction, the question shall be thrown out and a new question read for all the quizzers." }

			h3 { "3.1  COACHING" }
			h4 { "3.1.1 General.  The coach\'s responsibilities include encouraging spiritual growth in the lives of their quizzers (discipleship), prayerfully building and training a team, accompanying the team to tournaments, advising quizzers on strategy and game play (including the use of substitutions and time-outs), and representing the team to the local congregation and at large." }
			h4 { "3.1.2 Notes to the Coach: To build a team, relationships must be cultivated and enthusiasm generated. A good starter activity is to visit a quiz tournament with as many of your potential quizzers as possible. Enlisting the support of the Pastor, local Board of Administration, youth staff, and the parents of teens is crucial. Don\'t forget to let your Conference Bible Quiz Director know of your interest; he or she will be glad to give you valuable advice and support." }
			h4 { "3.1.3 Practices.  To train a team, schedule a regular time of practice; determine a study schedule (perhaps one chapter a week, with occasional reviews), employ principles of good teaching mixed in with asking questions over the text (teens need to understand in order to remember effectively); and supply loads of encouragement as needed. Take an interest in each individual quizzer, and communicate frequently about upcoming tournaments and retreats to keep excitement and study motivation high." }
			h4 { "3.1.4 Study tools.  Studying along with the quizzers also can serve as a valuable motivator and source of good fun and relationship building between you and your quizzers. You may wish to challenge your quizzers with some \"participation guidelines\" (like having read the chapter at least 3 times or knowing all chapter Quotes before each weekly practice), or some \"incentives\" (like taking the first quizzer who memorizes a certain chapter to McDonald\'s, etc.). 

			Note: Always be on the lookout for new quizzers, even after the quiz season is in progress." }
			h4 { "3.1.5 Tournaments.  Make sure to register properly in advance. Communicate with your church and parents of teens regarding all costs and scheduling for the trip, travel arrangements, etc.  It is suggested that a Parental Permission slip be collected from all parents." }
			h4 { "3.1.6 Register and set up.  When you arrive at a tournament, register and mobilize your quizzers, set up quiz seats and stand by for instructions. It is extremely important to make sure your chairs are working before you arrive at the quiz. Bring an extension cord to leave with the set." }

			h4 { "3.1.7 Pay attention during the quiz.  Be particularly alert during a quiz. This is not the time for the \"kids to do all the work.\" Pray with your team before each quiz. Appoint a team captain to represent your team\'s interests. Then follow along the best you can in your Bible. Give your prayer support and visible encouragement. Call a Time-Out if your team gets off to a slow start, and don\'t hesitate to use a substitute when you have a comfortable lead or when one or your \"regulars\" is having an \"off\" round. Be ready to appoint an \"acting captain\" if your captain is replaced by a substitute or quizzes out. Keep your own scoresheet and notes if possible to validate the Official Scoresheet and to discuss areas of possible improvement with your quizzers after the quiz. Be positive in your approach. Build their self-confidence and increase their desire to study God\'s Word." }
			h4 { "3.1.8 Sportsmanship is crucial. Cultivate a fine spirit among your team members by refraining from all criticism or judgment of the officials, other coaches, or quizzers. Make every effort by both your teachings and example to convey to quizzers the importance of applying God\'s Word that they have learned to life situations. The quiz is an ideal training ground. Quizzers keenly experience everything from the thrill of victory to the discouragement of defeat, and God\'s Spirit is needed to successfully handle both types of emotions. Help them to be sensitive to the needs of other people involved in the quiz: the officials, coaches, other quizzers, and even the fans. Let them know that God is always standing by to teach valuable lessons if we will let Him, and stress the fact that we often learn more from losing than winning. Better to lose points than tempers - quizzes than spiritual victory!" }
			h4 { "3.1.9 Advocate.  Be a spokesperson for the needs and interests of your quiz team in your local church. No other group has more to gain from a successful quiz ministry! Let them know that. Keep them informed of team activities and tournaments. Encourage them to pray, and don\'t be afraid to have an occasional fund-raiser to buy needed equipment or subsidize travel costs. Win or lose, maintain a spirit of optimism and confidence in your team. Remember, in Bible quizzing, everyone is a winner!" }
			h4 { "3.1.10 Engage.  You will also need to represent your team at tournaments and before your Conference and Regional quiz leaders. Share your ideas concerning new rules, rule interpretations, tournament schedules, and how they affect your ministry. Make positive suggestions for improvements." }

			h3 { "4.1  QUIZMASTERING" }
			h4 { "4.1.1 Note to the quizmaster: As the key official in every quiz, you have the responsibility to see that the quiz is conducted smoothly, efficiently, and fairly. This means, first, that you will need to become familiar with all rules and procedures outlined in this Rulebook. Second, resist the natural tendency to be defensive in judgments and attitudes. Relax, be confident in your own abilities and in the knowledge that God will help you. And yet be open and honest when faced with an appeal or criticism. The rules provide for reversing decisions which are clearly in error. Be gracious in reversing incorrect decisions and upholding right ones. Your goal should always be two-fold: 
			1) to fairly award points according to the rules, honoring the team which has most effectively mastered the content of God\'s Word, and 
			2) to edify and strengthen in faith the hearts and minds of all those participating.
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.2 Demeanor.  Your attitude will communicate itself to the teams, officials, and audience. So be relaxed, make no hasty decisions, proceed efficiently, and SMILE!  Frequently quizzers are scared stiff. Your smile, with a little humor mixed in, will go a long way toward reducing the pressure and making a better quiz. Enjoy your ministry! You are working with teenagers of amazing potential and ability, and God will bless your efforts. In moments of tense decision-making, it will help to remember the ultimate aim and purpose of Bible quizzing.  The mission of Free Methodist Bible Quizzing is \"to instill biblical truths in the heart of teens, establish them in their faith, and prepare them for Christian service through the systematic study, meaningful application, and memorization of the word of God.\" Bible Quizzing is an avenue for hiding away the living Word of God in the minds and hearts of youth to equip them to live a life of love and service to Christ. Therefore, prayerfully seek and expect the help of the Holy Spirit in performing this task. Please execute faithfully the following responsibilities, and consult the sections referred to in parentheses when clarification is needed.
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.3 Preparation.  The Quizmaster\'s responsibilities for each quiz include personal preparation, appointing the necessary contest officials, mobilizing quizzers and testing jump equipment, and conducting a fair and impartial quiz within the time limit and conditions prescribed by the tournament coordinator. 
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.4 Learn the rules.  In preparing for the quiz, Quizmasters must first become familiar with all regulations and procedures contained in this Rulebook. Next, they must secure the questions and scoresheets from the tournament coordinator. Quizmasters should then read the questions silently before the quiz to familiarize themselves with the phraseology and punctuation.  The scoresheet should be marked with the date, name of tournament, round number, room number, and name of the officiating Quizmaster.  Later the team and quizzer information will be recorded during introductions.  Team information includes both the team number and name. 
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.5 Other officials.  The Quizmaster is to appoint a scorekeeper and a timekeeper and make sure they are familiar with all rules pertaining to their position. Appoint answer consultants if appropriate.  If comfortable doing so, or if no other persons are available to help, the Quizmaster may keep score and/or time, unless directed otherwise by the Tournament Director.  Trophy rounds should be planned in such a way that a scorekeeper is always available.
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.6 Checklist.  Before a quiz begins, Quizmasters should: 
			1) Have the captains choose sides on the basis of a coin toss or mutual agreement. 
			2) Have captains introduce themselves, their team members, and their coaches. As this occurs, the scorekeeper will write the names on the scoresheet and Quizmasters should write the quizzers\' names in the mini scoresheet on the question page to enable them to call on the quizzers by name for answering. 
			3) Introduce themselves and all assisting officials. 
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.7 Testing equipment.  After the quizmaster directs all quizzers to take their seats, the jump chairs should be tested to see that they are all working properly by giving quizzers some practice jumps on numbers, colors, claps, etc. The Quizmaster and timekeeper should now position themselves so that both can see the lights clearly. If some of the chairs are not working properly, one of three things should be done: 
			1) fix the problem, if the repair is as simple as securing a loose wire or resetting the box; 
			2) If it is a single pad malfunctioning, check the carrying case for a spare pad or consult the tournament coordinator to find another set of jump sets as a replacement; or 
			3) work out a fair and just solution with both coaches which will allow for the accurate recording of jumping order or which will at least spread the handicap evenly to both teams (like switching sides at Half-time, if one team perceives a disadvantage).
			" }

			" }
			h4 { "4.1.9 End of Quiz.  After the 15th question (or end of overtime - see C-9), the Quizmaster shall:
			(a) Declare the last question officially closed.
			(b) Congratulate the performance of all quizzers.
			(c) Announce the official score.
			(d) Have coaches check the scoresheet and make sure it is filled out completely.

			(a) The Quizmaster should publicly announce all appeal deductions as soon as they apply (See Section J - Coach/Captain Appeals.)
			(b) The Quizmaster, even when calling on answer consultants for advice, makes the final decision on correctness. In difficult decisions, it is wise to seek insights from other quizmasters or even the tournament coordinator.
			(c) A Quizmaster shall not consider an answer until a Quizzer has been called upon to begin answering the question.
			(d) In the case of a prejump, a Quizmaster shall stop the reading of a question immediately. (See Prejumping.)
			(e) If no correct answer is given (or if no answers are given aloud in the case of a tie), it is a courtesy to give the correct answer to the quizzers and audience after the question is closed.
			(f) A question is closed after:
			   1) a Time-out has been granted by the Quizmaster, 
			   2) the Quizmaster starts the next question, or 
			   3) the Quizmaster announces \"The question is closed.\" After a question is closed, no appeals will be accepted and no rulings will be changed.
			" }
			h4 { "4.1.12 Procedures.  The Quizmaster is to observe proper procedures for reading questions, acknowledging jumps, ruling on Answers, and upholding all other rules during a quiz. If in error, the Quizmaster is to do whatever is necessary to see that points are awarded fairly." }
			h4 { "4.1.13 Quizmaster\'s Prerogative: A Quizmaster may change normal procedure (before the start of the next question) under either of these two conditions: 
			1) if it is necessary for the fair awarding of points in situations where following the rules would lead to an injustice; or 
			2) for personal preferences on procedures which are \"peripheral\" and not essential to the fair awarding of points.  
			In cases of personal preference, the Quizmaster must specify in advance the modification he or she is going to make so that all coaches and quizzers are aware of the difference in style. Prerogative of personal preference may obviously not be used to change \"basic rules\" on ruling, answering, etc. Only \"procedures\" may be adjusted. However, in adjusting normal procedure to make things fair (i.e. throwing out a question one quizzer has already heard, sending those participating in the appeal into the hall instead of those still eligible to answer when answers might be heard from another room, etc.), the Quizmaster may act without advance notice. Apart from these two conditions, however, a Quizmaster must go by the rules as closely as possible or be subject to an appeal of procedure.

			h4 { "5.1.1 Tournament Coordinator.   The tournament coordinator may be any Conference or Regional Bible Quiz Director, Coach, or other quiz leader who sets up and runs a quiz tournament.  The coordinator\'s job is to plan, publicize, and administer the tournament according to the rules and guidelines contained in this Rulebook." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.1 Tournament Questions.  If running an \"official\" tournament, the tournament coordinator shall receive \"Official Questions\" from the Conference Director and shall print/copy in advance a sufficient quantity for all simultaneous quizzes to be run." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.2 Promote event.  The tournament coordinator must first decide who to invite to the tournament. Details of the tournament should be publicized by mail, email, phone, social media, other Internet-based platforms, or in person considerably in advance of the tournament. A formal registration form might be used to find out how many teams and individuals are coming, what categories of quizzing they will enter, how many sets of jump seats and quizmasters they can bring with them, the number of persons for meals, if they will need overnight lodging, etc." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.3 Quizmasters.  Find enough capable Quizmasters to run the tournament.  Invite members of host congregations to train as Quizmasters if needed." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.4 Quizmaster training.  Ask new Quizmasters to read copy of the Rulebook at least a week in advance of the tournament. Ask local quizzers to conduct a demo quiz to give the new Quizmasters a real-life understanding of the mechanics and pacing of a quiz.  Arrange a Quizmasters\' meeting to explain the schedule and details of the tournament." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.5 Materials.  The Tournament Coordinator assembles all of the materials needed to run the tournaments: sets of questions in sufficient supply, scoresheets (if using digital scoresheets, the headings-team, round, room, QM-can be completed in advance and emailed to each Quizmaster), copies of Rulebooks for Quizmasters, schedules of the day\'s activities (including rounds, rooms, Quizmasters, and competing teams), maps of the host location and a Registration Form to help with team registration and statistics." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.6 Assistance.  Finally, other helpers may be needed to run the tournament. A statistician, spare Quizmaster, fix-it person for jump seats, cooks, even a babysitter, are possibilities. The coordinator for larger tournaments should avoid being scheduled as a Quizmaster to ensure availability to handle questions and logistical needs." }
			h4 { "5.1.1.7 Coordinator\'s Prerogative. Because Bible quizzing involves innovation and experimentation at the level of conference ministry and local tournaments, tournament coordinators have the privilege of revising rules and procedures and trying new ones at their discretion.

			h4 { "5.1.2 Conference Bible Quiz Director.  The Conference Bible Quiz Director (identified, approved and/or appointed by the Regional Director or Denominational Director) is to pray for and encourage the coaches of the conference, to promote FMBQ in the Conference, to arrange for tournaments on a regular basis, and to represent the ministry needs of the area to the Regional and Denominational quiz directors." }
			h4 { "5.1.2.1 Promotion ideas.  Mail or email a letter of invitation to all conference pastors; report tournament results in conference publications; target a few churches for \"sponsoring\" by existing teams who want to involve themselves in the ministry of planting new teams; and perhaps most importantly, keep those currently in quizzing involved in regular, meaningful competition and fellowship. Send a newsletter on a regular basis to all conference coaches; make telephone calls to encourage coaches." }
			h4 { "5.1.2.2 Tournament Questions.  It is the responsibility of the Conference Bible Quiz Director to secure Official Tournament Questions from the Denominational Director and to keep them confidential at all times. These questions should be given only to a designated Tournament Coordinator who has the job of overseeing a tournament, the Quizmasters involved in that tournament, and answer consultants (if they are used)." }
			h4 { "5.1.2.3 Schedules.  In addition to securing tournament questions, an annual schedule of conference competition should be compiled, seeking guidance from the Regional Director and considering the suggestions and input of area coaches. (It is wise to consult with neighboring conference directors to schedule tournaments to better coordinate planning, and to alternate \"conference\" with \"regional\" tournaments.) Tournament Coordinators should be appointed for each tournament. The tournament schedule should be publicized as soon as it is confirmed so that coaches can plan accordingly." }

			h4 { "5.1.2.4 Communication.  The Conference Director is to represent quizzing in the assigned area by regular communication with 
			1) the area\'s Regional Bible Quiz Coordinator, 
			2) local pastors in the Annual Conference, 
			3) the Denominational Director, and 
			4) any others who need updates in various areas so that they can provide effective help and support." }

			h4 { "5.1.3  Regional Bible Quiz Director.  Regional Bible Quiz Directors are appointed by the Denominational Director to promote and oversee Bible Quizzing in their regions. They shall pray for and communicate frequently with the Conference Bible Quiz Directors in their region, and report tournament news and ministry needs to the Denominational Director and/or anyone on staff who is responsible for publicizing this news or providing support for the ministry. They shall also serve on the FM Bible Quiz Leadership Team (which shall recommend policy and rule modifications for Bible Quizzing) along with the Denominational Director. A more detailed ministry description is available from the Denominational Director." }
			h4 { "5.1.4 Denominational Bible Quiz Director.  The Denominational Director is responsible for promoting Bible Quizzing at the denominational level, providing prayer support and encouragement to quizzing leadership, providing materials for church and conference quizzing ministries, and responding to other local needs as they arise. The director is responsible for coordinating the annual denominational Bible Quiz Finals, and for chairing the Bible Quiz Leadership Team, holding the final authority on all policy and rule decisions." }
