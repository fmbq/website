		<qa question="What were the highlights of your quizzing years?">The friendships made not only within my own church, but others in the quizzing program. These are some of my best friends still. It was always so fun to choose the quiz furthest away to attend, even if there were fewer teams. We were welcomed to spend the night at other quizzers' homes and get to know the quizzing families. We would stay an extra day and go to church with them before heading home. The Easter breakfasts we served to our church family as a fund raiser for Nationals were always a delight.</qa>
