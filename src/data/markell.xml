	<bio>Each year at Quiz Finals, a graduating senior is honored for their excellence in attitude.  This award is named in honor of Dave Markell.  Rev. David Markell served as the Director of Youth Ministries during the 1980's before his untimely death from leukemia. His leadership and advocacy of quizzing lives on through the lives of hundreds of quizzers, officials, and coaches to whom he ministered. His attitude, even as he faced death, was always one of calm, wisdom, and strength. His family has consented to the use of his name to honor the quizzer who most exemplifies the life of Christ through their attitude and behavior in quizzing.</bio>
